# proc_queue
Simple linux process queue tools including a SIGSTOP and SIGCONT based pause/unpause queue for already running procs.
Idea and runner.sh came from https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-that-is-similar-to-a-job-queue-in-Linux-Bash
The plan is to expand this to a portable and fully functional queueing system using only BASH with minimal tools.
